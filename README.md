# httpun-ws

httpun-ws is a Websocket implementation that uses http-un for the initial
connection and upgrade.

It started as a fork of
[websocketaf](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/websocketaf), but has since
diverged quite a bit, given the meager implementation in the original work.

## Installation

```bash
opam install httpun-ws
```
